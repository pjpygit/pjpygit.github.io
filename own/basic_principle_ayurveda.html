    <h3>
    2: Trigunas
        </h3>
    <p>
    Guna depending on the context means 'string, thread or strand', 
    or 'virtue, merit, excellence', or 
    'quality, peculiarity, attribute, property'. <br /> 
        </p>


    

    <p>
    Three Fundamental universal energies, 
    which are omnipresent at work behind all material forms in nature, <br />
    - <b>Satwa </b> (Consciousness or intellect): Whatever is pure and illuminating. Inferred as pleasure.  <br/>
    - <b>Rajas</b> (Motion or action): Whatever is active, energising & activating. Inferred as pain.  <br/>
    - <b>Tamas</b> (Inertia or resistance): Whatever is passive and offers resistance and restraints. Inferred as delusion.
        </p>


    <p>
    The three gunas are the three essential components or energies of the mind. </p> 
   <p>
         Ayurveda provides a distinct description of people on the basis of their 
    Manasa (psychological) Prakriti (constitution). Genetically determined, these psychological 
    characteristics are dependent on the relative dominance of the three gunas.
    </p> 


    <p>
While all individuals have mixed amounts of the three, 
        the predominant guna determines an individual's 
        mansa prakriti.In equilibrium, the three gunas
         preserve the mind (and indirectly the body), 
        maintaining it in a healthy state. Any disturbance 
        in this equilibrium results in various types of mental disorders.
    </p> 
    <p>
Satva characterised by lightness,consciousness, pleasure and clarity, 
        is pure, free from disease and cannot be disturbed in any way. 
        It activates the senses and is responsible for the perception 
        of knowledge.Rajas ,the most active of the gunas,has motion 
        and stimulation as its characteristics. All desires, wishes, 
        ambitions and fickle-mindedness are a result of the same.While 
        Tamas is characterised by heaviness and resistance. 
        It produces disturbances in the process of perception 
        and activities of the mind. Delusion,false knowledge, laziness, apathy, sleep and drowsiness are due to it.
        </p>
    <p>
Rajas and Tamas as with the dosas, 
        can be unbalanced by stress and negative desires as kama (lust), 
        irshya (malice), moha (delusion and hallucination), 
        lobha (greed),cinta (anxiety), bhaya (fear) and krodha(anger). 
        Each of these three properties is also comprised of sub-types 
        and the particular sub-type to which one belongs to determine the qualities of that individual.
 </p>

    <p>
     Satvika individuals are usually noble and spiritual in character, their nature determined as 
    much by body type as their star constellation, having an element of kapha in their constitution.:-

   4: Dhatus
        </h3>
    <p>
    Dhatus are tissues of the body. </p>
    <p>
    Nourishment of these seven body tisuues takes place in 
    sequential manner with original material provided 
    by digested food material. 
        </p>
    <p>
    Rasa provides contentment and saturation and nourishes blood, 
    blood generates clarity in complexion,nourish muscles and sustains life; 
    muscles strengthen the body and nourishes medas( fat), 
    medas gives rise to unctuous materials, sweat and firmness and nourishes asthi (bones), 
    asthi support the body and nourish marrow; 
    marrow provides function, strength, nourishes semen and fills up bones; 
    semen provides valour, discharge, pleasure, physical strength, exhilaration and is meant for reproduction or seed.
        </p>
    <p>
     The Sapta(seven) Dhatus (tissues) elements form the pillars of the body that 
    form the means of nourishment and growth while providing support to the body as well as the mind.
     </p>

    <p>
    Since the dhatus support and derive energy from each other, 
    affecting one can influence others. For instance, interference 
    in the manufacture of the plasma affects the quality of the blood, 
    which in turn effects the muscle. Each tissue type has its own agni, 
    which determines metabolic changes in the tissues and forms by-products, 
    which are either used in the body or excreted. 
    Menstural periods for example are a by-product of rasa. 
    The tissues are also governed by the three dosas, and any imbalance in them also causes imbalances in dhatus. 
    Heavy periods therefore can also be caused by the effects of the excess of Kapha on plasma.
    </p>



     <h3>
    5: Malas
        </h3>
    <p>
    Malas are the various waste products of food and the dhatus produced during 
    the normal digestive and metabolical process.

        The three primary malas being 
    Purisa(faeces), Mutra (urine) and Sveda (sweat).</p>

    <p>Ayurveda clearly states that 
    only a balanced condition of dosas, dhatus and malas is arogya (good health 
    or disease free condition) and their imbalance is the cause of ill health or disease.
</p><p>
Purisa is the waste left back after nutrients of digested food have been absorbed 
    in the small intestine. While water and salt are absorbed in the large intestine, 
     the residue now converted into solid faeces, leaves the body. The consistency of the 
    faeces depends both on gastrointestinal mobility and nature of diet.
    </p>
    <p>
The tridosas must be in balance to ensure normal evacuation. Pitta and kapha help 
    digestion and vata governs the mobility throughout the process. Any discrepancy 
    or imbalance between these can lead to various symptoms of abdominal heaviness or pain, 
    flatulence, constipation or diarrohea. It may also give rise to diseases as rheumatoid 
    arthritis, osteoarthritis, low-back pain, asthma, bronchitis as well as stomach ulcers and irritable bowels.
    </p>
    <p>
Mutra is derived during the course of biological processes within the human body. 
    The first stage of urine formation begins in the large intestine where fluids are 
    absorbed into the system. The entire urinary system (kidneys, uterus, bladder and urethra) 
    takes part in the formation and elimination of urine, regulating the fluid balance in our 
    body and also maintaining blood pressure. Any imbalance of increased or decreased urine, 
    may result in disorders such as kidney stones urinary infections, cystitis, abdominal pain and bladder disorders.
    </p><p>
Sveda is the third primary mala, and it occurs as a waste product during the synthesis of meda 
    dhatu (fatty tissue). Eliminated through skin pores, it controls body temperature and helps 
    to regulate the electrolytic balance. The channels responsible for bringing the sweat to skin 
    surface are known as sveda vaha srotas. It is essential that normal formation and flow of sweat 
    takes place as otherwise it may lead to skin infections, itching/burning sensation over the body, 
    loss of fluid balance and reduced body temperature.

 <h3>
    6: Agni
        </h3>

    <p>
    The biological fire that governs metabolism, agni encompasses all the changes in the body and 
    mind from the dense to the more subtle. Such changes include the digestion and absorption of food, 
    cellular transformations, assimilation of sensory perceptions and mental and emotional experiences. 
    Agni therefore covers whole sequences of chemical interactions and changes in the body and mind. 
    Digestive abilities being related to the strength of agni.
 </p>
    <p>
Agni and pitta are closely connected. While both are hot and light, agni is subtle and dry. 
    The heat energy to help digestion contained by pitta is agni. Pitta is therefore the container 
    and agni the content.Agni is acidic in nature and stimulates digestion. 
    It is subtly related to the movement of vata. In every tissue and cell agni is present and is 
    necessary for maintaining the nutrition and auto-immune mechanism. By destroying micro-organisms, 
    foreign bacteria and toxins in the stomach and the intestines.
 </p>
    <p>
A balanced agni therefore is vital for health. The strength of the body to resist disease and also its 
    physical strength are directly related to its heat energy determining the metabolic processes of the body. 
    Disturbances of Agni are usually the chief causes of disease.
 </p>
   
    
     <p>
    Your health depends on how well you can digest and utilize the food you take. 
        The digestive power is specific for every body type.</p>
<u>Body Type </u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	<u>Digestive Power </u><br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Vata &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	Changeable.  <br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Pitta	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strong <br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Kapha	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Slow <br />

    <p>
    The objective is to maintain or restore the digestive power you are endowed with and utilizing it in the best 
        possible way. Agni holds an important place in the principles of Ayurveda .Good health is indicated if 
        your digestion is ignited well which is shown if your food is being digested efficiently, 
        meets the requirements of the body cells and elimination of the waste products formed in 
        the body without being a trace of toxin left.
    </p>


    <h5> Classification/Types</h5>
    <p>
The Agni present in the body is classified into following thirteen typesâ 
    </p>
    <p>
    1. Jaathragni  or Pachak Agni (Digestive fire)- Pachak pitta present in the 
    small intestine contains this Agni. 
    It is responsible for digestion and also strengthen and nurture other types of 
    Agni present in the body in its natural or balanced state. 
    </p>
    <p>
    2. Sapta Dhatwagni - Agni which is present in all the seven tissues that form the body is called Dhatwagni. 
    It is named after the tissue it resides in. It is responsible for all the metabolic functions being 
    carried out at the respective tissue level.
         <br />
Rasa Dhatu Agni <br />
Rakta Dhatu Agni <br />
Maans Dhatu Agni <br />
Med Dhatu Agni <br />
Asthi Dhatu Agni <br />
Majja Dhatu Agni <br />
Shukra Dhatu Agni <br />
</p>
    <p>
3. Pancha Mahabhoota Agni - 
    These are five in number one for each Mahabhuta. 
    It is responsible to convert Asharir (Non body) Mahabhoota to Sharir (bodily) Mahabhoota. 
    Every thing in the universe is made up of Pancha Mahabhuta. Food as well as our body both are 
    formed of Panchamahabhuta. The Agni converts the Asharir Mahabhoota (external Mahabhuta) 
    to Sharir Mahabhuta. For instance when we drink water Jal Mahabhuta (water) is predominant. 
    The water is converted  to the Sharir Jal (body fluids)by Jal Mahabhuta Agni 
    The following are the Panchamahabhuta Agni:
         <br />
Akasha Mahabhuta Agni <br />
Vayu Mahabhuta Agni <br />
Agni Mahabhuta Agni <br />
Jal Mahabhuta Agni <br />
Prithvi Mahabhuta Agni <br />
        </p>
    <p>
Ayurveda believes that all the pathology occurs due to the impairment of Agni (Kaya). 
    Hence the rectification or treatment of  Kaya i.e. Agni is known as Kaya Chikitsa.
        </p>
Imbalance of Agni (the digestive fire) leads to the follwoing: <br />
Loss of appetite. <br />
Acidity or heart burn. <br />
Loose motions or constipation. <br />
Increased weight or loss of weight. <br />
Gastrointestinal tract ( Digestive tract) disorders.



 <h3>
    7: Kosta
        </h3>
    <p>
    This is the character of bowel movements, which are of four types.
</p><p>
Kruram (Constipative):	Vatha predominant </p><p>
Madhyam (Medium):	Pitta predominant</p><p>
Mridhu (Loose):	Kapha predominant</p><p>
Samam (Naturally formed):	Vatha-Pitta-Kapha balanced</p>
    <p>Each of these three divisions have further subdivisions not mentioned here.</p>

 <h3>8: Prakriti </h3>

 <p>  Prakriti is the natural tridosha constitution of the body which results 
     from the predominance of Doshas right from the moment of conception of a person. 
     Based on the permutations and combinations of the three Doshas, 
     seven types of constitutions can be formed.
     </p> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Vatha <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Pitta <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Kapha <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Vatha-Pitta <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Vatha-Kapha <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Pitta-Kapha <br />
     
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Sannipatha or balanced constitution (Sama Prakriti).<br />

          <p>   Doshic constitution takes shape right from the moment of conception. 
     The types are classified by their predominance. 
     A purely single Dosha constitution is seldom found and a balanced constitution, though extremely good, is also rare.
